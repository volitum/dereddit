# DeReddit

DeReddit is a Manifest V3 browser extension for Firefox and Google Chrome. It
helps you make Reddit intentional again by blocking selected destinations,
filtering communities from feeds, simplifying the interface, and putting a
finite window in front of infinite scrolling.

## Features

- Block the Reddit homepage, Popular, r/all, New, and Top pages.
- Block every subreddit front page.
- Add exact or wildcard subreddit rules such as `news`, `news*`, `*news`, or
  `*news*`. Use `HOME` mode to block only a subreddit's front and sorting pages. Use `ALL` mode to block every page in a subreddit and hide its posts in
  other feeds.
- Hide comments, the top navigation bar, and either sidebar independently.
- Hide blocked communities from popular-community panels.
- Limit modern Reddit feeds to a fixed number of posts or reveal one finite
  group at a time with a **Show next** button.
- Import and export settings as JSON.

## Browser support

- Firefox 140 or newer
- Firefox for Android 142 or newer
- Google Chrome 121 or newer

The extension has one shared codebase. Firefox runs a non-persistent background
script, while Chrome runs the equivalent extension service worker.

## Install for development

### Firefox

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Select **Load Temporary Add-on**.
3. Choose `src/manifest.json` from this repository.

### Chrome

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Select **Load unpacked**.
4. Choose the `src/` directory.

The development manifest contains both background declarations. Release builds
remove the declaration and browser metadata that do not apply to their target.

## Permissions

| Permission | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `storage` | Persist settings locally in the browser profile. |
| `declarativeNetRequest` | Redirect blocked top-level Reddit navigations to the bundled block page. |
| Reddit host access | Run the content script, read the current Reddit tab, and apply navigation rules. |

DeReddit does not collect or transmit user data. Version 2.0.0 makes no API
requests to Reddit or to third-party services. All code and assets are bundled
with the extension.

## Development

The default checks require only Node.js and Python 3; the extension itself has
no npm runtime dependencies.

```bash
npm test
npm run check
npm run build
```

`npm test` runs unit and DOM-harness regression tests for shared rules,
declarative redirects, the background lifecycle, content filtering, the popup,
the block page, and the feed window.

`npm run build` validates the source and creates deterministic archives in
`dist/`:

```text
dist/dereddit-firefox-2.0.0.xpi
dist/dereddit-chrome-2.0.0.zip
```

Set `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` to choose the timestamp embedded in release archives.

### Browser integration tests

The optional Selenium tests use a temporary extension and a local fixture. They
do not visit Reddit.

```bash
python3 -m venv /tmp/dereddit-browser-tests
/tmp/dereddit-browser-tests/bin/pip install selenium

/tmp/dereddit-browser-tests/bin/python tests/browser/firefox.py \
  --firefox /path/to/firefox

/tmp/dereddit-browser-tests/bin/python tests/browser/chrome.py \
  --chrome /path/to/chrome
```

Both suites verify a real declarative main-frame redirect on a local host. The
Firefox suite also covers the native popup UI and detailed feed behavior. The
Chrome smoke suite verifies MV3 service-worker startup, content filtering,
finite-feed behavior, popup persistence, and removal of the obsolete control.


## AI-assisted development

The code in this project has been developed using AI coding tools.

The project is human-directed: feature selection, requirements, technical decisions, testing, validation, and overall review are performed by the maintainer, while the implementation itself is produced with the assistance of AI.
